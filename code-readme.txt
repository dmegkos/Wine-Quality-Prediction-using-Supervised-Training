A Comparison of Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbour in Predicting Wine Quality

Dimitrios Megkos - 210034034

Matlab version: R2021b
Dependencies: Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
Other languages: Python used for EDA (Wine Quality EDA.ipynb file) to create plots using Seaborn library and use SMOTE technique for fixing class imbalance.


Instructions:
* Open file RFvsKNN.mlx and follow comments/instructions. If you want to only test the models on the testing set, click on the link "Click here to test the models on the testing set."



* To view the entire process of this exercise, right click on folder named “Custom functions”, add folder and subfolders to path in order to run the functions created for this exercise. You can either choose to run the file section by section or run the file as a whole.

Please note!!

The hyper-parameter optimisation function is also included on the file which requires around 6 minutes total to optimise both algorithms using the predefined hyper-parameter values. 

You can choose to skip this part and run the final models using the best hyper-parameters already found or reduce the range of numbers that are passed as hyper-parameters.

Thank you for running my code!
